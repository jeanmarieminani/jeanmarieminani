Hello everyone, 
My name is Jean-Marie Minani. 
I am interested in climate change, renewable energies and agricultural research. 
Recently, I have been exploring the use of Deep Semantic Segmentation and Computer Vision applications on satellite images to predict climate change impacts and mitigation measures. 
If you would like to connect with me, please send me an email on jeanmarie.minani2@gmail.com
